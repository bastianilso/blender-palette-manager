# Material Fade Tools
Blender plug-in for applying a palette of shadeless colors to objects easily

![The addon creates new materials and adds them to selected objects with colors specified in a palette by the user.](http://bastianilso.com/wp-content/uploads/2017/08/Screenshot-from-2017-08-06-22-47-15.png)

Adds a menu in the 'Tools tab of the T-Panel, with functionality to create materials and add them to selected objects, based on a user-defined palette of colors. This should be useful for motion graphics and simple animations made with cycles which don't require the complexity of Cycles' material nodes.
